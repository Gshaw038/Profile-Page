            <h1>Ball-Hockey</h1>
                <p>I've been playing hockey for many years now but more recently began playing competitive ball-hockey.</p>
                <p>My skills do not match my passion for the sport and the fun I have practicing it. But that means there is room to improve!</p>

            <h1>Content Creation</h1>
            <p>A friend and I have started dabbling in content creation, video editing and general humour.</p>
            <p>Realistically, it is a good excuse to hang out, play video games and have fun after the kids have gone to bed!</p>

            <h1>Reading and Writing</h1>
            <p>This one is fairly self explanatory. For more information, I'd invite you to strike a conversation with me. I'd love to discuss it more.
